# BackToFlapp
FlappyBall goes back to the past! 

## What is this? 
This is a class project for ECE Junior Design at the University of Pittsburgh. 

Using the ArduBoy (https://arduboy.com/) framework and the FlappyBall game (https://github.com/MLXXXp/FlappyBall), we added the functionality to go "back in time" and pause the game. 

## How to use
To use, simply download the `.ino` and `.h` files and download all of the ArduBoy libraries within the Arduino enviornment.
